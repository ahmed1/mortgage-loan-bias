# Mortgage-loan-bias



In this project, I used sklearn and themis_ml packages to look for biases in mortgage loan approval ratings based on different factors. I used logistic regression on a model with all the features as the baseline. I then removed multiple features and trained 5 separate models with on bias removed at a time that I suspected may be a cause for unfairness.

The dataset used here included 11.7 million loan application records reported by 7,062 financial institutions from 1992 - 2014.

I think it would be interesting to isolate the data by year and try to see if the bias detected decreases or increases each year in different categories.
